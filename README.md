*Task Team is an application built using Ruby on Rails.*

Task Team was built to provide an organized and efficient way to manage projects and tasks.

It was built with full CRUD functionality. 
* That being said, a user has the ability to:
     * Create, update, and delete their user
     * Update, delete, and join teams
     * Create, update, and delete projects
     * Create, update, and delete tasks
     * Comment on a task
     
Through this application, a user can better organize projects by breaking down a larger project 
into smaller tasks and asigning each task to specific members of the team. Comments can be made 
on tasks to communicate with other members of a team, as well as update other members of the 
team on the progress of a task. 
Also, with the ability to mark tasks and projects as complete, Task Team provides an environment
that motivates members to complete tasks, in turn being more productive.
